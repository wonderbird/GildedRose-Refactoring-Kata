# Project Workflow Orchestrator

This file defines the primary workflows for this project.

## Pre-Commit Workflow

Before every git commit, you MUST follow these steps in this exact order:

1.  **Run Unit Tests**: Ensure all tests pass.
    ```shell
    dotnet test
    ```
2.  **Run Mutation Tests**: Get the latest mutation score.
    ```shell
    dotnet stryker --reporter json
    ```
3.  **Commit with Memory Bank Update**:
    - First, update the memory bank (per `general/500-cline-memory-bank.mdc`) with the results from the steps above.
    - Then, create a single git commit (per `general/330-git-usage.mdc`) that includes the changes to the code, tests, and memory bank.
