# Project Brief

## Project Name
Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata - C# xUnit

## Purpose
This is a refactoring kata project focused on improving code quality through test-driven refactoring. The Gilded Rose is a shop that sells items with varying quality update rules.

## Core Requirements
- Maintain existing behavior while improving code structure
- Apply strict TDD (Test-Driven Development) principles
- Improve code readability, extensibility, and maintainability
- All code changes must be covered by tests before refactoring

## Current State
- Production code contains deeply nested conditionals
- Approval tests exist to verify behavior
- Some unit tests need attention (GildedRoseTest.foo has "fixme" assertion)

## Success Criteria
- Code is more readable and maintainable
- Design pattern implemented appropriately
- All tests pass
- Code coverage maintained or improved
