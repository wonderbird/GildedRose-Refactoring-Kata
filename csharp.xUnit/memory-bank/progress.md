# Progress

## What Works
- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ Test project configured and runs
- ✅ Eight characterization tests created and passing:
  - `NormalItem_DecreaseSellIn_AfterOneDay`: Verifies SellIn decreases by 1
  - `NormalItem_DecreaseQuality_BeforeSellByDate`: Verifies Quality decreases by 1 before sell-by date
  - `NormalItem_DecreaseQualityTwiceAsFast_AfterSellByDate`: Verifies Quality decreases by 2 after sell-by date
  - `NormalItem_QualityNeverNegative`: Verifies quality boundary (cannot go below 0)
  - `AgedBrie_IncreaseQuality_BeforeSellByDate`: Verifies Aged Brie quality increases by 1
  - `AgedBrie_IncreaseQualityFaster_AfterSellByDate`: Verifies Aged Brie quality increases by 2 after sell-by
  - `AgedBrie_QualityNeverExceedsFifty`: Verifies quality boundary (cannot exceed 50)
  - `BackstagePasses_IncreaseQualityByOne_MoreThanTenDaysBeforeConcert`: Backstage passes +1 quality (SellIn > 10)
- ✅ Stryker.NET configured and tested
- ✅ Mutation testing showing steady improvement:
  - Initial baseline: 6% (1 test) - 6 killed, 16 survived
  - After 3 tests: 21% - 21 killed, 11 survived
  - After 4 tests: 22% - 22 killed, 10 survived
  - After 5 tests: 28% - 28 killed, 10 survived
  - After 6 tests: 32% - 32 killed, 10 survived
  - After 7 tests: 33% - 33 killed, 9 survived
  - After 8 tests: 38% - 38 killed, 10 survived
  - Normal item and Aged Brie complete, Backstage passes in progress

## What's Left to Build
### Immediate
- Continue building characterization tests to improve mutation score from 6%

### Test Coverage Needed (Priority Order)
- Backstage passes quality increase patterns:
  - 10-6 days before concert (quality +2)
  - 5-0 days before concert
  - After concert (quality drops to 0)
- Sulfuras behavior (no changes)
- Quality boundary conditions (0-50 range)
- Edge cases (negative SellIn, etc.)

### Refactoring Phase (After Test Coverage)
- Refactor UpdateQuality method for clarity
- Maintain all tests green throughout
- Use mutation testing to verify test effectiveness

## Current Status
**Phase**: Characterization testing (building test coverage)
**Tests**: 8 passing
**Mutation Score**: 38% (38 killed, 10 survived, 52 no coverage)
**Coverage Progress**: Normal items complete, Aged Brie complete, Backstage passes in progress
**Next Action**: Test Backstage passes 10-6 days tier (quality increases by 2)
**Blockers**: None

## Known Issues
- Test coverage improving well (8 tests, 38% mutation score)
- 52 mutants have no coverage - still need more Backstage passes tests and Sulfuras
- 10 mutants survived in covered code - 1 new survivor (likely Backstage passes edge case)
- No refactoring done yet (intentional - need tests first)

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Decision 1**: Start with simplest possible test (SellIn decrease) rather than quality changes, to establish testing pattern with least complexity
- **Decision 2**: Create memory bank structure before proceeding further to ensure proper documentation from the start
- **Decision 3**: First test committed successfully using conventional commit format with Co-authored-by trailer
- **Decision 4**: Ran mutation testing early (after 1 test) to establish baseline - 6% score with 129 mutants identified
- **Decision 5**: Second test focuses on quality decrease for normal items - building coverage incrementally for normal item behavior first
- **Decision 6**: Third test covers accelerated quality degradation after sell-by date - completing basic normal item behavior coverage
- **Decision 7**: Re-ran mutation tests after 3 tests - score improved from 6% to 21% (3.5x), validating our incremental approach
- **Decision 8**: Fourth test adds boundary condition (quality cannot go below 0) - completing normal item test coverage before moving to special items
- **Decision 9**: Ran mutation tests after 4th test - score 22% (up from 21%), killed 1 more mutant, 1 fewer survivor
- **Decision 10**: Fifth test covers Aged Brie (first special item) - mutation score jumped to 28% (6 more mutants killed), opening new code path
- **Decision 11**: Sixth test covers Aged Brie after sell-by date - mutation score 32% (4 more mutants killed), completing basic Aged Brie behavior
- **Decision 12**: Seventh test adds upper boundary (quality ≤ 50) - mutation score 33%, killed 1 more mutant AND reduced survivors to 9
- **Decision 13**: Eighth test starts Backstage passes (first tier) - mutation score jumped to 38% (5 more mutants killed!), opening Backstage passes code path
